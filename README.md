# KnockOut
A game that I made during my first year for my Java module

Built on a game engine derived from the same engine that powered Angry Birds.
I was Intended for us to build a 2D platformer but I decided to go for a top-down 1v1 game based on StreetSmash from Super Smash Bros. for 3DS.

It is very poorly optimised and some things do not work properly such as save states and unpausing the game. 

With my current knowledge I could probably make this game far better but I'd rather remake the game using better tools for the job. 

Here are the Controls!

P1: Rotate with A and D and move forward with W
P2: Rotate with Left Arrow and Right Arrow and move forward with Up Arrow

Your Aim is to win 3 out of 5 Matches by knocking your opponent off the screen.
You can collect a boost power up that lasts the entire round once collected.
